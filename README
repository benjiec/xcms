XCMS Extensions and Fixes
=========================

Ginkgo Bioworks' version of XCMS. Originally "forked" from version 1.39.2 from
Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/xcms.html).

Main changes are 

  1. centWave peak detection algorithm improvement.

  With this change, XCMS now picks the best scale for a peak using CWT
  coefficient, rather than fixed area integration. Using fixed area integration
  tends to favor narrower peak shape, even though a broader peak shape is
  better. To fine tune a broad peak, XCMS now narrows down the RT range of a
  peak by skipping regions less than 1% of the max intensity, rather than
  skipping regions with 0 intensities.



Compile and Installation
------------------------

To install to ~/R, run ". install_xcms".

Alternatively, you can run "python setup.py install" or include this repository
in your Python project's requirements.txt file.

To use this copy of the XCMS library, run the following in R (lib.loc specifies
where package is installed).

> library(xcms,lib.loc='~/R')

or run R with the following environment variable: R_LIBS_USER=~/R

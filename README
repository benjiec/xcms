XCMS Extensions and Fixes
=========================

Ginkgo Bioworks' version of XCMS. Originally "forked" from version 1.39.2 from
Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/xcms.html).

Main changes are 

  1. centWave peak detection algorithm improvement.

    With this change, XCMS now picks the best scale for a peak using CWT
    coefficient, rather than fixed area integration. Using fixed area
    integration tends to favor narrower peak shape, even though a broader peak
    shape is better. To fine tune a broad peak, XCMS now narrows down the RT
    range of a peak by skipping regions less than 1% of the max intensity,
    rather than skipping regions with 0 intensities.

    See commit 6b2a60d486

  2. centWave integration improvement.

    Add Tony Larson's integration improvement, to handle non-uniform scan
    densities. See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/xcms-devel/bdkvPGSWOU0

    See commit 21dbf6e7da

  3. Add targeted peak detection to centWave.

    Prior to this change, XCMS does not pickup weak peaks consistently or at
    all. I believe XCMS fails to pickup these peaks for three reasons.

    1) XCMS tries to identify "regions of interest" (ROI) prior to peak
    detection and integration. It may fail to pick up a weak peak with only a
    few spikes spanning several scans as an ROI.

    2) XCMS can only pick up ROIs with contiguous scans. This was mentioned in
    the centWave peak detection paper, and correlates with behavior of the
    code. To handle weak peaks with scan gaps, XCMS extends each ROI laterally
    (in time domain) by a multiple of the specified minimum peak width, prior
    to running peak detection on the ROI. But if the specified minimum peak
    width is small, this lateral extension may not pick up all the scans that
    make up the real peak.

    3) XCMS throws away an ROI if it believes there aren't enough above-noise
    signals in the ROI. XCMS determines the noise level locally, from an
    average of the signals in the ROI. For weak peaks, real signals can be
    considered as noise, causing an ROI with weak peak to be thrown away before
    peak detection.

    Targeted peak detection using XCMS works around all three of these
    problems. First, each target is defined as a triple (mz range, scan range,
    peak width range). Then, for each target, construct manually an ROI
    covering the mz and scan ranges of the target. Finally, run CWT peak
    detection on that ROI, using the target peak width range. CWT peak
    detection works over large scan ranges and can pick up multiple peaks
    within the scan range.



Compile and Installation
------------------------

To install to ~/R, run ". install_xcms".

Alternatively, you can run "python setup.py install" or include this repository
in your Python project's requirements.txt file.

To use this copy of the XCMS library, run the following in R (lib.loc specifies
where package is installed).

> library(xcms,lib.loc='~/R')

or run R with the following environment variable: R_LIBS_USER=~/R

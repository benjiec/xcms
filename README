XCMS Extensions and Fixes
=========================

Ginkgo Bioworks' version of XCMS. Originally "forked" from version 1.39.2 from
Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/xcms.html).

Main changes are 

  1. centWave peak detection algorithm improvement.

  With this change, XCMS now picks the best scale for a peak using CWT
  coefficient, rather than fixed area integration. Using fixed area integration
  tends to favor narrower peak shape, even though a broader peak shape is
  better. To fine tune a broad peak, XCMS now narrows down the RT range of a
  peak by skipping regions less than 1% of the max intensity, rather than
  skipping regions with 0 intensities.

  See commit 7a12243565

  2. centWave integration improvement.

  Add Tony Larson's integration improvement, to handle non-uniform scan
  densities. See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/xcms-devel/bdkvPGSWOU0

  See commit 1980288a05
